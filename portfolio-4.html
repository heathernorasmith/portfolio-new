    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>I worked with a team of design masters students at IIT to research food insecurity on campus and look for solutions to help close the food gap.We created a pitch for a strategic partnership betwen colleges, Farmerâ€™s Fridge and the Greater Chicago Food Depository.The goal of the partnership is to close the gap between students experiencing hunger and food that would otherwise be wasted. GCFD brings food expertise on alleviating hunger and advocacy, Farmers Fridge understands food distribution, and IIT brings the food facilities and student groups to support repackaging food. Together, we can work to address hunger.</p>
